# II-lecture-notes

These are typeset lecture notes for some courses in the Cambridge University II Tripos.

Each course has its own folder, which is the initials of the course (this may be changed). Each folder contains two files: a PDF output of the notes, and the tex source file. Note to compile the tex file, you need the ishn sty file.

Let me know if there are errors.
