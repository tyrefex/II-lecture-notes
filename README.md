# IB-lecture-notes

These are typeset lecture notes for (hopefully) most courses in the Cambridge University IB Tripos, taken in 2022/23.

Each course has its own folder, which is the initials of the course (this may be changed). Each folder contains two files: a PDF output of the notes, and the tex source file. Note to compile the tex file, you need the ishn sty file.

If you find any errors, **please let me know** so the notes can be quickly updated.
